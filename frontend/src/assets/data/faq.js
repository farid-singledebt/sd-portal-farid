    question: "Can the bank reject your offer when setting up a DMP?",
    answer:
      "Initially the creditors may not accept the reduced EMI since the initial loan agreement has already been defaulted. Do not worry, negotiations can last up to 6 months, in the meantime, your creditors will receive the amount agreed on the DMP until negotiations have been concluded. In this instance, whilst we are in the negotiation stage, it is very important that you maintain the DMP arrangement with us without missing any payments as this may go against you when trying to solidify the new arrangement. During this stage, your creditor may ask you directly for the full amount of the EMI, and they are within their rights to do so, however, as we are your representatives, you can direct this communication to us until the DMP has been accepted.",

    question: "Would a settlement be more beneficial for me than a DMP?",
    answer:
      "If you can make a settlement, then yes, that option is there for you, but please note that in some cases your credit score is affected permanently due to settlement. However, if you have multiple creditors to whom you have outstanding debts with, then the question is; Will you be able to honor your remaining EMI's? If the answer is no, then a settlement may not be the right answer. A Debt Management Plan is designed to deal with all your creditors simultaneously and efficiently. It will ensure that your creditors are being treated fairly whilst you are in an arrangement. If your circumstances change for the better and you can clear your outstanding debts, then you can instruct us to do that for you where we will negotiate a settlement amount on your behalf.",

    question: "Why would my creditor accept the offer?",
    answer:
      "Creditors are in the business of lending money; they make their profit from charging interest on the money they lend out. If you are unable to repay the money back, then the creditor's first option is to offer you a settlement. In many cases, the settlement is not a viable option for the debtor and so the creditor will begin to chase the debtor for the full EMI, regardless of your circumstance. However, once you are on our DMP, you are instantly protected by our legal team. Our team of experts will liaise with your creditors to present your case of hardship and your willingness to repay the outstanding debt. Once the creditor is aware that you have a full legal team working on your behalf you will find that the negotiations can commence. It takes few months by creditors to accept our offer as they would look for consistent payments from a defaulted account before any new agreement.",

    question: "Will my interest will be freeze?",
    answer:
      "Creditors will not freeze the interest and charges initially, because they would need to monitor your loan account to make sure that you are honoring your new payments. After six months we will be asking for your interest and charges to be frozen or reduced. In the case of credit cards, we will request that the amount outstanding is converted to an unsecured loan at a reduced interest rate.Our lawyers will also undertake a “full financial audit” on all your loan documents to check that the creditors had followed RBI guidelines when giving you the loan. If we discover that these RBI guidelines were not followed, our lawyers will demand that the loan is written off or the interest and charges suspended or written off from the initial date of the loan.",

    question:
      "Will the payment made be considered towards the principal debt or the interest?",
    answer:
      "It solely depends on the revised EMI amount and classification of your loan account based on your earlier missed payments and penalties and interests due in consequence to the same. The revised EMI will go towards reducing the total debt outstanding (principal, interest and charges). This is because the creditors will need to be satisfied that you are able to maintain the payments over a period of six months or more. Only then will the creditors entertain any request from our lawyers to freeze or reduced the interest.",

    question: "Will my harassment stop?",
    answer:
      "When you sign up to our DMP, our lawyers will inform all your creditors that we are now dealing with all your debts and that all communications should be directed to us only. You will also receive a letter of engagement from us confirming the appointment of our lawyers, which you can show to any creditor that visits you at home or at work. This will usually stop the creditors from harassing you, but if the creditors are still persistent then our lawyers will draft out notices and will Advice you to register a complaint to the police in the form of a NC (Non-Cognizable) or FIR (First Information Report). But you must note that our lawyers can only use the law to stop harassment and this can take up to eight weeks to stop all harassment.",

      "We are working and communicating with these financial companies daily and we have built good relationships with them. Our working relationship is improving day by day. Some of the financial institutes have approached us with praise, it's only a matter of time until the rest of the institutes willingly come on board as our debt plan is beneficial for all parties involved. There are different types of lending institutes ranging from NBFC to app and private lenders. Hence, even if we have relationship with many it would be difficult to have existing relationship with all. We follow rules laid by authorised bodies hence it is anyways immaterial whether we do have relationship with these lending institutes or not.",
